# Pokedex
MDB Mini-Project 2

The Pokedex app does exactly what you'd think its supposed to do. Users can scroll through a preliminary list of pokemon and when one of the entries is clicked, the user is taken to a detail page with information on the pokemon's ID, type, and stats. There is also a button to do a web search on that specific pokemon. Back on the main page, users can also search and filter the list of pokemon. Search by name/number, or filter by type or power stats. Finally, users can also hit a random button which is located on the filters page, and this button will present the user with a list of 20 random pokemon. 

The core concepts used in this application include the following:
 - Recylcer Views
 - Glide & Async Tasks
 - Dynamic/Live Searches
 - Search/Tool Bar
 - Drawer View
 - Model Classes
